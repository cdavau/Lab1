        Built for racetracks, master of the road" - for 20 years the 3 series has been entirely devoted to the world of motorsport. 
        The fourth generation BMW M3 GTR is all about adding the finishing touches to perfection. 
        A light, high revving naturally aspired V8 race engine sits at the front of the M3 GTR. 
        With a peak power of 550 bhp at 8500 rpm and a 8700 rpm redline the M Power engine performs best when it is spinning fast. 
        A distinctive carbon-fibre reinforced plastic roof helps reduce weight and significantly lower the centre of gravity while bonnet vents, rear spoiler and diffuser effectively minimize uplift. 
        Motorsports is the DNA of the BMW M3 GTR.
